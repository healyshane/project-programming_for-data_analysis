    "Glaciers are dynamic. Snow falls at the glaciers highest elevation. Over time the snow is compacted and turns to ice. As the weight of the ice increases, as a result of gravity, the glacier will slowly flow downhill. \n",

    "At a lower altitude down the glacier is the ablation area where majority or melting and evaporation occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "A glacier is in equilibrium when snowfall equals snowmelt. When the equilibrium is disturbed by a change in either snowfall or melting, the glacier either retreats or advances <sup>[1](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/)</sup>. \n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Glaciers are important indicators of global warming and climate change. As Earth’s average temperature has been increasing for more than a century the study and modelling of glaciers is important to highlight risks to Earth's population.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Melting ice causes rising sea levels. The sea level would rise approximately 70 meters if all the ice covering Antarctica, Greenland, and mountain glaciers around the world was to melt. All costal cities would be submerged <sup>[XXXXXXX](https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/earth/ask-a-scientist-about-our-environment/will-the-world-ever-be-all-under-water)</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large additions of fresh water from melting glaciers change the ocean ecosystem. Ocean organisms, such as many types of corals, depend on salt water for survival and may not survive a more diluted environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The loss of glacial ice also reduces the amount of fresh water available for humans, animals and plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large icebergs, breaking off glaciers into the sea, create hazards for the shipping industry <sup>[BBBBBBB](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/glacier/)</sup>. "
